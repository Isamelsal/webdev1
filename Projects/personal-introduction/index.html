    <h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Hello my name is Isamel Salvador, and if my name is hard for you to pronounce you can call me ice. My favorite colors are red and black. I'm not really into an artwork. I am an anime person if you wold consider that an artwork. I am excited to learn programming and anything else that'll help me in the field of technology, but I'm not excited that it's going to become colder and colder. If you press the window, control, and D key at the same time it will allow you to open a new virtual desktop </p>
